# Terminal configuration

This script prioritise `iTerm2` and `ZSH` with [**Oh My ZSH!**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) based configuration. It will setup [`agnoster`](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) theme by default however this does not perfectly working out of the box and require manual setup to work. The script will installs the required fonts([Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)) and [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) colorscheme for it to be ready to use.

You will need to go to the Preference setting of your iTerm2 as follow:

- Go to Profile > Colors > Color Presets > Pick `Solarized Dark` or `Solarized Light`
- Go to Profile > Text > Change Font > Search for `Powerline` > Pick whatever you like but `Noto Mono for Powerline` is pretty nice.

After this you may remove Solarized folder from `~/dotfiles/zsh` if necessary.
